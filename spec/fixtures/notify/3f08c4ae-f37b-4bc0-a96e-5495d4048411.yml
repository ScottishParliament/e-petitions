  Dear ((creator)),
  
  You’re not done yet!
  
  Forward the email below to your potential supporters.
  
  ((moderation_threshold)) people need to click the link and confirm their support for us to publish your petition.
  
  Once you’ve gained the required number of supporters, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition standards. If it does we’ll publish it. This usually takes a week or less but over the Easter period it will take us a little longer than usual. We’ll check your petition as quickly as we can.
  
  Thanks, 
  The Petitions team
  The Scottish Parliament
