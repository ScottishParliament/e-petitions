  Dear ((sponsor)),
  
  Thank you for supporting a petition. 
  
  Before we can publish a petition on our website and it can begin to collect signatures, we need to ensure that it meets the petition rules. 
  
  Unfortunately, we are not able to accept the proposed petition “((action))”. 
  
  ((content_gd))
  
  We only reject petitions that don’t meet the petition standards:
  ((standards_url_gd))
  
  Thanks,
  The Petitions team
  The Scottish Parliament
