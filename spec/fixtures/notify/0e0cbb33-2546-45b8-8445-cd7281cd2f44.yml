  Dear ((creator)),
  
  You’re not done yet!
  
  Forward the email below to your potential supporters.
  
  ((moderation_threshold)) people need to click the link and confirm their support for us to publish your petition.
  
  Once you’ve gained the required number of supporters, we’ll check your petition to make sure it meets the petition criteria. If it does, we’ll publish it and let you know. This usually takes a week or less, however we have a very large number to check at the moment so it is likely to take longer. Thank you for your patience.
  
  Thanks, 
  The Petitions team
  The Scottish Parliament
