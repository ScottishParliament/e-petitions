    descriptions:
      irrelevant: |-
        It’s about something that the Senedd or Welsh Government is not responsible for.
      duplicate: |-
        There’s already a petition about this issue. We cannot accept a new petition when we already have one about a very similar issue, or if the Petitions Committee has considered one in the last year.
      no-action: |-
        It’s not clear what the petition is asking the Senedd or Welsh Government to do.

        Petitions need to call on the Senedd or Government to take a specific action.
      bad-address: |-
        We can only accept petitions from people who live in Wales or organisations with a base in Wales.
      fake-name: |-
        People who create petitions are required to provide a full, real name, as well as their address and contact details. Sorry if this wasn’t clear to you.

        We are rejecting your petition for that reason, but if you resubmit your petition with a full name and contact details, we may able to approve it.
      insufficient: |-
        It did not collect enough signatures to be referred to the Petitions Committee.

        Petitions need to receive at least %{threshold_for_referral} signatures before they can be considered in the Senedd.
      not-suitable: |-
        It included issues relating to an issue for which a petition is not the appropriate channel, or personal information which it would not be appropriate to publish.
      libellous: |-
        It included potentially confidential, libellous, false or defamatory information, or a reference to a case which is active in the UK courts.
      offensive: |-
        It’s offensive, nonsense, a joke, or an advert.
