        is one of the most direct ways to suggest how something could change. Petitions
        can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\r\n  <li>Raise awareness of an
        issue;</li>\r\n  <li>Bring about a change in Welsh Government policy or a
        different way of delivering services;</li>\r\n  <li>Propose or influence a
        new law;</li>\r\n  <li>Prompt a Senedd Committee to hold an inquiry;</li>\r\n
        \ <li>Lead to, or influence, a debate in the Senedd;</li>\r\n  <li>Prompt
        a Committee or individual Members of the Senedd to take further action themselves,
        for instance by asking questions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit a
        petition using our online petitions system, on paper, or a combination of
        the two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u>Petitions from other websites are not accepted by
        the Petitions Committee.</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are considering collecting
        signatures on paper, you should <b>contact us</b> in advance for advice. A
        template can also be provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1 class=\"page-title\" id=\"how-petitions-work\">How
        petitions work</h1>\r\n\r\n<ol class=\"list-number\">\r\n  <li>You create
        a petition. Only people or organisations with an address in Wales can create
        a petition.</li>\r\n  <li>You get 2 people to support your petition. We’ll
        tell you how to do this when you’ve created your petition.</li>\r\n  <li>We
        check your petition, then publish it in Welsh and English. We only reject
        petitions that don’t meet the standards for petitions (see below).</li>\r\n
        \ <li>People can only sign a petition once. If they sign the petition online,
        they will be sent an email to verify their signature. People cannot sign both
        an online and a paper petition.</li>\r\n  <li>The Petitions Committee reviews
        all petitions that collect over 50 signatures. They will decide what they
        can do to help take the petition forward. This can include exploring the issue
        and pressing for action from the Welsh Government and others.</li>\r\n  <li>If
        your petition gets over 5,000 signatures, the Petitions Committee will consider
        asking for a debate in the Senedd chamber. The Committee will consider a number
        of factors, including the issues raised by the petition, the urgency of the
        situation and the proportion of signatures which come from within Wales.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2
        id=\"the-petitions-committee\">The Petitions Committee</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As part
        of their consideration of your petition, the <a href=\"https://www.assembly.wales/en/bus-home/committees/Pages/Committee-Profile.aspx?cid=430\">Petitions
        Committee</a> can:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\r\n  <li>write to
        you for more information;</li>\r\n  <li>invite you to talk to the Committee
        in person about the petition;</li>\r\n  <li>ask for evidence from the Welsh
        Government or other relevant people or organisations;</li>\r\n  <li>press
        the Welsh Government for action;</li>\r\n  <li>raise the petition with another
        Senedd committee;</li>\r\n  <li>put forward the petition for debate;</li>\r\n
        \ <li>run a detailed inquiry and publish a report on the topic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2
        id=\"standards\">Standards for petitions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can submit a petition
        on any issue that is the responsibility of the Senedd or the Welsh Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petitions
        must call for a specific action from the Senedd or Welsh Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petitions
        can disagree with the Welsh Government and can ask for it to change its policies.
        Petitions can be critical of the Senedd or Welsh Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
        reject petitions that don’t meet the rules. If we reject your petition, we
        will tell you why. If we can, we will suggest other ways you could raise your
        issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll have to reject your petition if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul
        class=\"list-bullet\">\r\n  <li>It calls for the same action as a petition
        that’s already open, or one which was closed by the Petitions Committee less
        than a year earlier;</li>\r\n  <li>It doesn’t ask for a clear action from
        the Senedd or Welsh Government;</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>It’s about something
        the Welsh Government or Parliament is not responsible for;</p>\r\n    <p>That
        includes: something that your local council is responsible for (including
        planning decisions); something that the UK Government or Parliament is responsible
        for; and something that an independent organisation has done.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n
        \ <li>It contains language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative.
        This not only includes obvious profanities, swear words and insults, but any
        language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive;</li>\r\n  <li>It
        contains potentially false or potentially defamatory statements;</li>\r\n
        \ <li>It refers to a case that’s active in the UK courts;</li>\r\n  <li>It
        contains material that is prohibited from being published by an order of a
        court or a body or person with similar power;</li>\r\n  <li>It accuses an
        identifiable person or organisation of a crime;</li>\r\n  <li>It contains
        material that could be confidential or commercially sensitive;</li>\r\n  <li>It
        could cause personal distress or loss;</li>\r\n  <li>It names individual officials
        of public bodies, unless they are senior managers;</li>\r\n  <li>It names
        family members of elected representatives or officials of public bodies;</li>\r\n
        \ <li>It’s an advert, spam, or promotes a specific product or service;</li>\r\n
        \ <li>It’s nonsense or a joke;</li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p>It concerns an issue
        for which a petition is not the appropriate channel.</p>\r\n    <p>That includes:
        correspondence about a personal issue and petitions which ask for someone
        to be given a job, lose their job or resign, or which call for a vote of no
        confidence.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We publish the text of petitions
        that we reject, as long as they’re not:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"list-bullet\">\r\n
        \ <li>defamatory, libellous or illegal in another way;</li>\r\n  <li>about
        a case that is active in the UK courts or about something that a court has
        issued an injunction over;</li>\r\n  <li>offensive or extreme;</li>\r\n  <li>confidential
        or likely to cause personal distress; or</li>\r\n  <li>a joke, an advert or

        id=\"handing-in-your-petition\">Handing in your petition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We
        offer the opportunity for you to hand in your petition once it has finished
        collecting signatures, and before it is discussed by the Petitions Committee.
        This is an informal occasion to speak to the Chair and other Members of the
        Committee about the background to the petition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Petition handovers
        take place at the Senedd on Tuesdays and Wednesdays when the Senedd is sitting
        and last approximately 10 - 15 minutes. Photographs are taken and can be published
        on the Committee’s webpage and social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any

          <p>Last update: January 6 2020</p>

          <p>The Petitions site lets you start and sign petitions to raise issues with the Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Petitions service is provided by the Parliament. We need to collect, process and store some personal data to enable you to do this.</p>

          <p>A data controller determines how and why personal data is processed. The Welsh Parliament is the data controller of this site.</p>

          <p>The data controller for Parliament is the Clerk of the House.</p>

          <h3>What data we collect from you</h3>

          <p>The personal data we collect from people who start and sign petitions will include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your name</li>
            <li>your email address</li>
            <li>your postcode</li>
            <li>the country you live in</li>
            <li>whether you are a British citizen</li>
            <li>the IP address you use when starting or signing a petition</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The legal basis for processing this data is public task – allowing you to raise issues with the Welsh Parliament.</p>

          <h3>Why we need your data</h3>

          <p>We use this information to:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>make sure that people only sign a petition once</li>
            <li>check that you’re eligible to sign a petition</li>
            <li>contact you about petitions you start</li>
            <li>if you consent, email you updates about what happens in Parliament petitions you’ve signed</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What we do with your data</h3>

          <p>If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published with the petition. We won’t publish any other personal information about you.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, we won’t publish any personal information about you.</p>

          <p>We’ll use your postcode to work out how many people in each parliamentary constituency have signed a petition.</p>

          <p>We will not:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
            <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

          <h3>What we’ll email you about</h3>

          <p>If a petition you’ve started or signed gets a response from the Government, we’ll email the response to you.</p>

          <p>If you’ve started or signed a petition, we might contact you to let you know about relevant things that are happening in Parliament and Government. That might include: debates that you can watch or read, chances to respond to a consultation, or ways to let MPs know why the petition is important to you.</p>

          <p>You can stop these emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email.</p>

          <h3>How long we keep your data</h3>

          <p>We will retain your personal data from the date you start or sign a petition, until 6 months after that petition closes – a maximum of 12 months in total.</p>

          <h3>Where your data is processed and stored</h3>

          <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>

          <p>All personal data on Petitions is processed, stored and managed entirely in the European Economic Area (EEA), and will not be transferred outside of it. This means that it is covered by EU Data Protection regulations.</p>

          <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure.

        <h1 class="page-title">Determination by the Presiding Officer under Standing Order 23.3 of the Proper Form of Petitions</h1>

        <p>The Presiding Officer has made the following determination of the proper form of public petitions submitted under Standing Order 23.</p>

        <ol class="list-number">
          <li>
            <h3>Means and format for submission</h3>
            <p>Petitions may be submitted on paper or electronically using the Senedd’s online petitions system. Petitions may collect signatures for a maximum period of six months.</p>
            <p>For a paper petition the petition wording should be set out in full on each sheet (or side of a sheet) where signatures are asked for. A template is available on request.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Wording</h3>
            <p>Petitions should be submitted in good faith. They should call for the Senedd or the Welsh Government to take some specific action.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Basic Requirements</h3>
            <p>Petitions must clearly indicate:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>the name of the petitioner, who may be an individual or an organisation;</li>
              <li>the petitioner’s address, which must be in Wales, to which all communications concerning the petition should be sent;</li>
              <li>signatures from at least 50 people who support the petition and their names and addresses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must not:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>contain language which is offensive, intemperate, or provocative. This not only includes obvious profanities swear words and insults, but any language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive;</li>
              <li>ask the Senedd to do anything which it clearly has no power to do (in particular petitions about matters that are not devolved are not admissible);</li>
              <li>be the same as, or substantially similar to, a petition which was closed less than a year earlier.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must comply in other ways with this determination.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Other factors concerning admissibility</h3>
            <p>Petitions that include or ask the Senedd to consider the following are not admissible:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>to intervene in the operational decisions or actions of local authorities and National Park Authorities, including planning decisions;</li>
              <li>to adjudicate, arbitrate or mediate personal or commercial interests (this is the role of a court or tribunal);</li>
              <li>matters that are ‘sub judice’ (subject to legal proceedings in the courts);</li>
              <li>matters that are already subject to determination by an ombudsman (or person with similar powers).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Petitions must not contain:</p>
            <ul class="list-bullet">
              <li>potentially false or potentially defamatory statements;</li>
              <li>information which is prohibited from being published by an order of a court or a body or person with similar power;</li>
              <li>material which is potentially confidential, commercially sensitive, or which may cause personal distress or loss;</li>
              <li>any commercial endorsement, promotion of any product, service or publication or statements that amount to advertisements;</li>
              <li>the names of officials of public bodies, unless they are part of the senior management of those organisations;</li>
              <li>the names of family members of elected representatives or officials of public bodies;</li>
              <li>the names of individuals, or information where they may be identified, in relation to criminal charges;</li>
              <li>issues for which a petition is not the appropriate channel (for example, correspondence about a personal issue).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Freedom of Information (FOI) requests</h3>
            <p>Petitions that are essentially FOI requests will not be allowed. There are other specific arrangements for FOI requests.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Public Services Ombudsman for Wales (PSOW) cases</h3>
            <p>Petitions alleging specific cases of maladministration or service failure by public bodies are not admissible. In these cases petitioners are advised to contact the PSOW to take forward their concerns.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
