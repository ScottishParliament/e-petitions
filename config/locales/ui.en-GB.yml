        <h1 id="page-heading">Creating a petition</h1>

        <p>Petitions are a way to ask the Parliament to do something. Petitions can:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>Raise awareness of an issue</li>
          <li>Bring about a change in Scottish Government policy or a different way of delivering national services</li>
          <li>Propose a new law</li>
          <li>Lead to, or influence, a debate in the Chamber.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All petitions should be made using our online petitions system. If you cannot use the system, please get in touch with the <a href="/contact">Public Petitions team</a>.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="how-petitions-work-heading">
          <h2 id="how-petitions-work-heading"><a name="how-petitions-work"></a>How petitions work</h2>

          <ol class="list-number">
            <li>Any person or organisation can submit a petition. You do not have to be a certain age or live in Scotland (but your petition must be about something that is <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/about/how-parliament-works/powers-of-the-scottish-parliament">“devolved”</a> within the Scottish Parliament’s powers).</li>
            <li>You do not need to collect signatures on your petition. If you choose to collect signatures, this will start once your petition has been published by the Public Petitions team and run for four weeks.</li>
            <li>Once we have received your petition, the Public Petitions team will check to make sure it meets the <a href="/rules">Parliament’s rules</a> and is clear. Petitions that don’t meet these rules will be rejected.</li>
            <li>People can only sign a petition once. If they sign the petition online, they will be sent an email to verify their signature.</li>

          <p>The <a href="/contact">Public Petitions Committee</a> looks at all published petitions, regardless of whether signatures are collected. The Committee will decide what action it wants to take. This can include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>asking for evidence from the Scottish Government, other organisations, or people</li>
            <li>writing to the petitioner for more information or inviting them to talk to the Committee about the petition</li>
            <li>“referring” (sending) the petition to another committee</li>
            <li>recommending actions for the Scottish Government</li>
            <li>asking for a debate about the petition in the Chamber</li>
            <li>closing the petition.</li>
          </ul>

        <section aria-labelledby="rules-heading">
          <h2 id="rules-heading"><a name="rules"></a>Rules about petitions</h2>

          <p>Petitions must be about:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>something that is within the powers of the Scottish Parliament</li>
            <li>an issue of national policy or practice</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Petitions cannot ask the Scottish Parliament to become involved in a local or individual matter, or to intervene in a decision that should be taken by another organisation.</p>

          <p>Petitions must call for a specific action that the Scottish Parliament should take.</p>

          <p>Petitions can disagree with the Scottish Government and can ask for it to change its policies. Petitions can be critical of the Scottish Government.</p>

          <h2 id="rejections-heading"><a name="rejections"></a>Why we might reject your petition</h2>

          <p>The Public Petitions team reject petitions that do not meet the <a href="/rules">rules</a>. If we reject your petition, we will tell you why. If we can, we will suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

          <p>We'll have to reject your petition if:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>
              <p>It’s about something that’s not within the powers of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
              <p>That includes: something that your local council is responsible for (including planning decisions); something that the UK Government or Parliament is responsible for; and something that an independent organisation has done.</p>
            </li>
            <li>It calls for the same action as a petition that’s already open, or one which was closed by the Public Petitions Committee less than a year earlier.</li>
            <li>You already have 2 petitions being looked at by the Scottish Parliament.</li>
            <li>It calls for something that relates to a law currently being looked at by the Parliament or has been in the last 12 months.</li>
            <li>It does not include details of relevant previous action taken to address the issue, such as raising it with the Scottish Government or one of your MSP’s.</li>
            <li>It contains language which is defamatory, offensive or inappropriate. This not only includes obvious profanities, swear words and insults, but any language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive.</li>
            <li>It names individuals or otherwise contains information that could lead to the identification of any individual. This excludes MSPs and senior leaders of public bodies.</li>
            <li>It contains any false statements. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to ensure that statements are accurate.</li>
            <li>It refers to a matter that is the subject of continuing court proceedings.</li>
            <li>It seeks a decision on an individual or commercial matter.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The full rules for petitions are in:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">

              <p>Before you petition the Scottish Parliament, you must provide information about what you’ve already done to raise the issue. You should contact at least <a href="https://www.parliament.scot/msps/current-and-previous-msps">1 of your MSPs</a> or the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/about/contact-information/">Scottish Government</a> before submitting a petition. You will also need to let us know what happened as a result of your contact.</p>
              <p>For example, if you contacted an MSP, what was their response to your petition idea?</p>
              <p>Good examples</p>
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>I have raised the issue with Sam Brown MSP who held a debate in the chamber</li>
                <li>I met with the Minister for Children and Young People who explained the wellbeing and safety of children and young people in Scotland is a key priority for the Scottish Government</li>
              </ul>

                <li>I have made my views known on social media</li>

          <p>The Petitions site lets you start and sign public petitions to raise issues with the Scottish Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Public Petitions process is provided by the Scottish Parliament. We need to collect, process and store some personal data to enable you to do this.</p>

          <h3>Data Controller</h3>

          <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) is the data controller of the information you provide and will ensure it is protected and used in line with data protection legislation.</p>

          <h3>Our Contact Details</h3>

          <p>Any queries regarding our use of your information should be sent to the Data Protection Officer at:</p>

          <p><a href="mailto:dataprotection@parliament.scot">dataprotection@parliament.scot</a> — <a href="tel:01313486913">0131 348 6913</a></p>

          <h3>What data we collect from you</h3>

          <p>The personal data we collect from people who sign petitions will include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your name</li>
            <li>your email address</li>
            <li>your postcode</li>
            <li>the country you live in</li>
            <li>the IP address you use when starting or signing a petition</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, for people who start a petition we will also collect:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>organisation you are petitioning on behalf of (if applicable)</li>
            <li>your postal address</li>
            <li>your contact telephone number</li>
            <li>any personal information or details that you provide within the petition itself.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We sometimes receive information relating to people who have submitted petitions in writing. These petitions are securely stored and retained for the same period as personal data received through our own electronic petitions system.</p>

          <h3>Why we need your data</h3>

          <p>We use this information to:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>facilitate the public petitions process</li>
            <li>make sure that people only sign a petition once</li>
            <li>check that your petition is admissible</li>
            <li>contact you about petitions you start</li>
            <li>we may occasionally contact people who start or submit petitions to seek feedback on the petitions process and how it could be improved.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What we do with your data</h3>

          <p>We use your personal information to process the petition you have started or signed.</p>

          <p>If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published alongside any text you include within the petition. We will not publish any of your contact details. If you start a petition, your name will remain permanently referenced alongside the petition on the Public Petitions Committee’s web pages and in meeting transcripts and recordings, as part of the official record of the Scottish Parliament’s petitions process. This information will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament archive at National Records of Scotland where it will be publicly available.</p>

          <p>Your petition, including your name, will be included in data about parliamentary business that will be available on the Parliament’s Open Data Portal on an ongoing basis. The Open Data Portal can be accessed here: <a href="https://data.parliament.scot/#/home">data.parliament.scot/#/home</a></p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, we will not publish any personal information about you.</p>

          <p>IP addresses are used to protect the petitions site and prevent fraudulent activity.</p>

          <h3>What we’ll email you about</h3>

          <p>If a petition you’ve started is referred to the Public Petitions Committee, we will use your contact details to update you about the petition’s progress and to offer you the opportunity to provide further information and engage with the Committee.</p>

          <p>You will receive automated confirmation emails when you set up or sign a petition.</p>

          <h3>Who has access to the data and where is it processed and stored</h3>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament’s staff administering the petitions process will have access to your personal information.</p>

          <p>Unboxed Consulting Limited who provide technical support for the petitions system will also have access to the system for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes only.</p>

          <p>Electronic information will be stored on Scottish Parliament ICT systems, which includes third party cloud services provided by Microsoft. Any transfer of data by Microsoft outside of the EEA is covered by contractual clauses under which Microsoft ensure that personal data is treated in line with European legislation.</p>

          <p>The petitions system uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage to store your data and to send emails relating to the petitions process. Emails sent are stored for 6 months. The privacy notice for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is available here: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/">aws.amazon.com/privacy</a>.</p>

          <p>Petitions form part of the public record. They will be retained according to the Scottish Parliament’s record management policy and transferred publicly to the Scottish Parliament archive at National Records of Scotland where they will be publicly available.</p>

          <h3>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h3>

          <p>We are committed to keeping your personal data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for us are required to keep that data secure.</p>

          <h3>Our legal bases for collecting, holding and using your personal information</h3>

          <p>Data protection law sets out various legal bases (or ‘conditions’) which allow us to collect, hold and use your personal information.</p>

          <p>The collection and use of your information are necessary to help us facilitate the public petitions process and allow the public the chance to raise and show support for issues with The Scottish Parliament.</p>

          <p>Personal data is processed because it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), read together with section 8(d) of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <li>the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament (the rules for how the Parliament works)</li>

        <section aria-labelledby="standing-orders-heading">
          <h2 id="standing-orders-heading"><a name="standing-orders"></a>Standing Orders Rules</h2>

          <h3>Rule 15.4.2</h3>
          <p>A petition must clearly state:</p>
          <ol class="list-alpha">
            <li><span>(a)</span> the name of the petitioner;</li>
            <li><span>(b)</span> an address of the petitioner to which all communications concerning the petition should be sent; and</li>
            <li><span>(c)</span> the name and address of any person supporting the petition.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Rule 15.5.1</h3>
          <p>A petition is admissible unless it:</p>
          <ol class="list-alpha">

        <section aria-labelledby="determination-heading">
          <h2 id="determination-heading"><a name="determination"></a>Determination on proper form of petitions</h2>

          <p>To be read alongside the Parliament’s rules on public petitions, the Public Petitions Committee has made the following determination under Rule 15.4.3 on proper form of petitions.</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Petitions should be submitted using the Scottish Parliament’s online petitions site. All sections should be completed.</li>
            <li>If an individual has no access to or difficulty in using the online petitions site, or if the site is unavailable, a petition may be submitted in paper form using the word template.</li>
            <li>A petition may be brought in any language.  Where a language other than English is used, the Parliament will provide a translation.</li>
            <li>Petitions should be brief and state clearly what action is being sought.</li>
            <li>No supplementary information (such as correspondence, legal information, photographs, or copies of Freedom of Information requests) will be accepted as part of a petition.</li>
            <li>Petitions must relate to national policy or practice as opposed to a local or individual matter.</li>
            <li>Petition titles should be a short factual description that explains what is sought but not a slogan or campaign name. For example “changes to the law about fatal accident inquiries” would be an appropriate title. “Betty’s Law” or “Justice for Betty” would not be.</li>
            <li>Previous action taken on a petition must include raising the issue with a relevant decision maker such as the Scottish Government (or other relevant public body) or an elected representative such as an MSP.</li>
            <li>A petition will not be considered by the Public Petitions Committee if the same (or substantially similar) petition, submitted by the same petitioner, has previously been considered by the Committee and closed at its first consideration on three consecutive occasions.</li>

            <li>
              <p>Petitions should not:</p>
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Name individuals or otherwise contain information that could lead to the identification of any individual. This excludes elected representatives and senior managers of public bodies. </li>
                <li>Contain any false statements.  It is the responsibility of the petitioner to ensure that statements are accurate. </li>
                <li>Refer to any matter that is the subject of continuing court proceedings.</li>
                <li>Seek an adjudication or decision on an individual or commercial matter.</li>
                <li>Seek to involve the Public Petitions Committee in a decision that is more properly the domain of another body (for example complaints, court appeals, planning appeals, local authority expenditure decisions etc.)</li>
                <li>Include language or wording that is defamatory, offensive, or inappropriate, for example swear words, insults, sarcasm or other language that could reasonably be considered offensive by a reader.</li>
              </ul>
