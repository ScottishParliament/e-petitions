        <h1 class="page-title" id="creating-a-petition">Creating a petition</h1>

        <p>Petitions are a way to bring something to the attention of the Scottish Parliament. Petitions can:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>Raise awareness of an issue;</li>
          <li>Bring about a change in Scottish Government policy or a different way of delivering national services;</li>
          <li>Propose a new law;</li>
          <li>Lead to, or influence, a debate in the Chamber.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>All petitions should be made using our online petitions system. If you can’t use the system, please get in touch with the <strong>public petitions team</strong>.</p>

        <h1 class="page-title" id="how-petitions-work">How petitions work</h1>

        <ol class="list-number">
          <li>Petitions are open to everyone. You don’t have to be a certain age or live in Scotland, but your petition must be about something that is <strong>“devolved”</strong> (within the Scottish Parliament’s powers).</li>
          <li>You don’t need to collect signatures on your petition. If you choose to collect signatures, this will start once your petition has been published by the public petitions team and run for four weeks.</li>
          <li>Once we have received your petition, the public petitions team will check to make sure it meets the <strong>Parliament’s rules</strong> and is clear. Petitions that don’t meet these rules will be rejected.</li>
          <li>People can only sign a petition once. If they sign the petition online, they will be sent an email to verify their signature.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="the-petitions-committee">The Public Petitions Committee</h2>

        <p>The <strong>Public Petitions Committee</strong> looks at all published petitions, regardless of whether signatures are collected. The Committee will decide what action it wants to take. This can include:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>asking for evidence from the Scottish Government or other relevant organisations;</li>
          <li>writing to the petitioner for more information or inviting them to talk to the Committee in person about the petition;</li>
          <li>“referring” (sending) the petition to another committee</li>
          <li>recommending actions for the Scottish Government</li>
          <li>asking for a debate about the petition in the Chamber</li>
          <li>closing the petition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rules">Rules about petitions</h2>

        <p>Petitions must be about:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>something that is within the powers of the Scottish Parliament</li>
          <li>an issue of national policy or practice</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Petitions can’t ask the Scottish Parliament to become involved in a local or individual matter, or to intervene in a decision that should be taken by another organisation.</p>

        <p>Petitions must call for a specific action that the Scottish Parliament should take.</p>

        <p>Petitions can disagree with the Scottish Government and can ask for it to change its policies. Petitions can be critical of the Scottish Government.</p>

        <h2 id="rejections">Why we might reject your petition</h2>

        <p>The public petitions team reject petitions that don’t meet the <strong>rules</strong>. If we reject your petition, we will tell you why. If we can, we will suggest other ways you could raise your issue.</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>
            <p>It’s about something that’s not within the powers of the Scottish Parliament.</p>
            <p>That includes: something that your local council is responsible for (including planning decisions); something that the UK Government or Parliament is responsible for; and something that an independent organisation has done.</p>
          </li>
          <li>It does not include details of relevant previous action taken to address the issue, such as raising it with the Scottish Government or one of your MSP’s.</li>
          <li>It contains language which is defamatory, offensive or inappropriate. This not only includes obvious profanities, swear words and insults, but any language which a reasonable person would regard as offensive.</li>
          <li>It names individuals or otherwise contains information that could lead to the identification of any individual. This excludes MSPs and senior leaders of public bodies.</li>
          <li>It contains any false statements. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to ensure that statements are accurate.</li>
          <li>It refers to a matter that is the subject of continuing court proceedings.</li>
          <li>It seeks a decision on an individual or commercial matter.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The full rules for petitions are in:</p>

        <ul class="list-bullet">
          <li>the <strong>Standing Orders</strong> of the Scottish Parliament (the rules for how the Parliament works)</li>
          <li>a <strong>determination</strong> agreed by the Public Petitions Committee</li>

          <h2 id="privacy-heading">Privacy notice: how we use your data</h2>

          <p>Last update: 13 November 2020</p>

          <p>The Petitions site lets you start and sign petitions to raise issues with the Scottish Parliament (referred to hereafter as Parliament).</p>

          <p>The Petitions service is provided by Parliament. We need to collect, process and store some personal data to enable you to do this.</p>

          <h3>Data Controller</h3>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is the data controller of the information you provide, and will ensure it is protected and used in line with data protection legislation.</p>

          <h3>Our Contact Details</h3>

          <p>Any queries regarding our use of your information should be sent to the Data Protection Officer at:</p>

          <p>dataprotection@parliament.scot 0131 348 6913</p>

          <h3>What data we collect from you</h3>

          <p>The personal data we collect from people who sign petitions will include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your name</li>
            <li>your email address</li>
            <li>your postcode</li>
            <li>the country you live in</li>
            <li>the IP address you use when starting or signing a petition</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, for people who start a petition we will also collect:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>your postal address</li>
            <li>your contact telephone number</li>
            <li>any personal information or details that you provide within the petition itself.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We sometimes receive information relating to people who have signed petitions on paper. Paper petitions are securely stored and retained for the same period as personal data received through our own electronic petitions system. They are destroyed in a secure manner at the end of the retention period.</p>

          <h3>Why we need your data</h3>

          <p>We use this information to:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>facilitate the petitions process</li>
            <li>make sure that people only sign a petition once</li>
            <li>check that you’re eligible to start a petition</li>
            <li>contact you about petitions you start</li>
            <li>if you choose to sign up to email updates about what happens in Parliament on petitions you’ve signed</li>
            <li>we may occasionally contact people who start or submit petitions to seek feedback on the petitions process and how it could be improved.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What we do with your data</h3>

          <p>We use your personal information to process the petition you have started or signed.</p>

          <p>If you start a petition and we accept it, your name will be published alongside any text you include within the petition. We won’t publish any of your contact details. If you start a petition, your name will remain permanently referenced alongside the petition on the Public Petitions Committee’s web pages and in meeting transcripts and recordings, as part of the official record of Parliament’s petitions process.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, we won’t publish any personal information about you.</p>

          <p>We’ll use your postcode to work out how many people in Scotland and within each Parliament constituency and region have signed a petition.</p>

          <p>We will retain your personal data from the date you start or sign a petition until 12 months after it is no longer being considered by the Public Petitions Committee, i.e. until 12 months after the Committee considers the petition to be completed, apart from any personal data which has been published.</p>

          <p>Any information which has been published will remain permanently online in the records of Parliament’s petitions process, including in any material published by the Public Petitions Committee.</p>

          <p>IP addresses are used to protect the petitions site and prevent fraudulent activity.</p>

          <p>We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

          <h3>What we’ll email you about</h3>

          <p>If a petition you’ve started is referred to the Public Petitions Committee, we’ll use your contact details to update you about the petition’s progress and to offer you the opportunity to provide further information and engage with the Committee.</p>

          <p>You will receive automated confirmation emails when you set up or sign a petition.</p>

          <p>If you’ve signed a petition, you can choose to receive updates about the progress of the petition. This might include contacting you to let you know what is happening in Parliament in relation to your petition, such as: debates that you can watch or read, chances to respond to a consultation, or ways to let committees and Members of the Scottish Parliament know why the petition is important to you.</p>

          <p>We may occasionally use your contact details to seek your views on Parliament’s petitions process.</p>

          <p>You can stop these emails at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email.</p>

          <h3>Who has access to the data and where is it processed and stored</h3>

          <p>Scottish Parliament staff administering the petitions process will have access to your personal information.</p>

          <p>Unboxed Consulting Limited who provide technical support for the petitions system will also have access to the system for troubleshooting and maintenance purposes only.</p>

          <p>Electronic information will be stored on Parliament ICT systems, which includes third party cloud services provided by Microsoft. Any transfer of data by Microsoft outside of the EEA is covered by contractual clauses under which Microsoft ensure that personal data is treated in line with European legislation.</p>

          <p>The petitions system uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud storage to store your data. AWS store data within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>

          <p>The petitions system uses the GOV.UK Notify service to send emails relating to the petitions process including updates. Emails sent are stored for 7 days. The privacy notice for the GOV.UK Notify service is available here: <a href="https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy">www.notifications.service.gov.uk/privacy</a>.

          <h3>How we protect your data and keep it secure</h3>

          <p>We are committed to doing all that we can to keep your data secure. We set up systems and processes to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure of the data we collect about you – for example, we protect your data using varying levels of encryption. All third parties who process personal data for us are required to keep that data secure.</p>

          <h3>Our legal bases for collecting, holding and using your personal information</h3>

          <p>Data protection law sets out various legal bases (or ‘conditions’) which allow us to collect, hold and use your personal information.</p>

          <p>We consider that our collection and use of your information is necessary to help us facilitate the petitions process and allow the public the chance to raise and show support for issues with Parliament.</p>

          <p>As such, personal data is processed on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest in accordance with Article 6(1)(e) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), read together with section 8(d) of the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <p>Where we are required to process personal data in order to comply with a legal obligation, such as a request under access to information legislation or a court order, we will do so on the basis that processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR.</p>

          <p>We may process personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences. In order to comply with Article 10 of the GDPR, this data will be processed in accordance with our Article 6 legal basis, as outlined above, and section 10 of, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to, the Data Protection Act 2018.</p>

          <p>Finally, we may process special categories of personal data of those who start or sign a petition, and/or contribute to its passage through Parliament’s petitions process. Special category personal data is defined in Article 9(1) of the GDPR as the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>

          <p>Special category personal data will usually be processed on the basis that it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, pursuant to Article 9(2)(g) of the GDPR read in conjunction with section 10 of, and paragraph 6 of Schedule 1 to, the Data Protection Act 2018. However, where your special category personal data is made public by you, it may be processed on the basis that it has already been manifestly made public by you, pursuant to Article 9(2)(e) of the GDPR.</p>

          <h3>Requests for information made to the Commission</h3>

          <p>Parliament is subject to access to information legislation. In the event of a request for information being made under access to information legislation, it may be necessary to disclose all or part of the information that you provide. However, we will only do this if we are required to do so by law.</p>

          <h3>What are your rights</h3>

          <p>You have certain rights over the information we hold. In summary, the rights include:</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>The right to be informed about how your personal information is used;</li>
            <li>The right of access to copies of your personal information;</li>
            <li>The right to rectification if your information is inaccurate;</li>
            <li>The right to restrict our use of your personal information in certain circumstances;</li>
            <li>The right to object to the use of your personal information in certain circumstances.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you would like to engage any of these rights, please email dataprotection@parliament.scot</p>

          <h3>Changes to this notice</h3>

          <p>We may change this privacy notice. In that case the ‘last updated’ date at the top of this page will also change. Any changes to this privacy notice will apply to you and your data immediately. If these changes affect how your personal data is processed, we will take reasonable steps to make sure you know.</p>

          <h3>How to complain</h3>

          <p>You can also complain to the ICO if you are unhappy with how we have used your data.</p>

        <h1>Scottish Parliament Petition Rules</h1>

        <p>The rules for petitions to the Scottish Parliament are set out in two places: the Standing Orders of the Scottish Parliament (the rule book for how the Parliament works) and a document (known as a determination) agreed by the Public Petitions Committee.</p>

        <section aria-labelledby="standing-orders">
          <h2 id="standing-orders">Standing Orders Rules</h2>

          <h3>Rule 15.4.2</h3>
          <p>A petition must clearly state: (a) the name of the petitioner; (b) an address of the petitioner to which all communications concerning the petition should be sent; and (c) the name and address of any person supporting the petition.</p>

          <h3>Rule 15.5.1</h3>
          <p>A petition is admissible unless it: (a) does not comply with Rule 15.4.2 or is otherwise not in proper form; (aa) is frivolous; (ab) breaches any enactment or rule of law; (ac) refers to any matter in relation to which legal proceedings are active; (b) contains language which is offensive; (ba) fails to raise issues of national policy or practice; (c) requests the Parliament to do anything which the Parliament clearly has no power to do; or (d) is the same as, or in substantially similar terms to, a petition brought during the same session of the Parliament and which was closed less than a year earlier.</p>
        </section>

        <section aria-labelledby="determination">
          <h2 id="determination">Public Petitions Committee</h2>
        
          <h3>Determination on proper form of petitions</h3>
        
          <p>To be read alongside the Parliament’s rules on public petitions, the Public Petitions Committee has made the following determination under Rule 15.4.3 on proper form of petitions.</p>

          <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>Petitions should be submitted using the Scottish Parliament’s online petitions site. All sections should be completed.</li>
            <li>If an individual has no access to or difficulty in using the online petitions site, or if the site is unavailable, a petition may be submitted in paper form using the word template (available from the clerks).</li>
            <li>A petition may be brought in any language. Where a language other than English is used, the Parliament will provide a translation.</li>
            <li>Petitions should be brief and state clearly what action is being sought.</li>
            <li>No supplementary information (such as correspondence, legal information, photographs, or copies of Freedom of Information requests) will be accepted as part of a petition.</li>
            <li>Petitions must relate to national policy or practice as opposed to a local or individual matter.</li>
            <li>Petition titles should be a short factual description of what is being looked for not a slogan or campaign name. For example “changes to the law governing fatal accident inquiries” would be an appropriate title. “Betty’s Law” or “Justice for Betty” would not be.</li>
            <li>Previous action taken on a petition must include raising the issue with a relevant decision maker such as the Scottish Government (or other relevant public body) or an elected representative such as an MSP.</li>
            <li>A petition will not be considered by the Public Petitions Committee if the same (or substantially similar) petition, submitted by the same petitioner, has previously been considered by the Committee and closed at its first consideration on three consecutive occasions.</li>
            <li>
              <p>Petitions should not:</p>
              <ul class="list-bullet">
                <li>Name individuals or otherwise contain information that could lead to the identification of any individual. This excludes elected representatives and senior managers of public bodies.</li>
                <li>Contain any false statements. It is the responsibility of the petitioner to ensure that statements are accurate.</li>
                <li>Refer to any matter that is the subject of continuing court proceedings.</li>
                <li>Seek an adjudication or decision on an individual or commercial matter.</li>
                <li>Seek to involve the Public Petitions Committee in a decision that is more properly the domain of another body (for example complaints, court appeals, planning appeals, local authority expenditure decisions etc.)</li>
                <li>Include language or wording that is defamatory, offensive or inappropriate, for example swear words, insults, sarcasm or other language that could reasonably be considered offensive by a reader.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>All petitions which meet the Parliament’s rules will be published and considered by the Public Petitions Committee. Petitions should be submitted using the Parliament’s online system but may be submitted in hard copy or email if a petitioner is not able to use the petitions system or the system is unavailable.</li>
